# vohumana-markdowntooffice

Repo for my Office add in that converts markdown to a word doc.

## High level overview of what needs to be done
  - Get text from a text box that is assumed to be markdown
  - Process the markdown
  - Insert the markdown into the word document

## Notes:
  - Odds are I will have to use the font property to properly insert the formatted text: https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-js-docs/blob/WordJs_1.3_Openspec/word/resources/font.md
